// Class description:
//
//   The G4TriangularFacet class is used for the contruction of
//   G4TessellatedSolid.
//   It is defined by three vertices, which shall be supplied in anti-clockwise
//   order looking from the outsider of the solid where it belongs.
//   Its constructor:
//   
//      G4TriangularFacet (const G4ThreeVector Pt0, const G4ThreeVector vt1,
//                         const G4ThreeVector vt2, G4FacetVertexType);
//
//   takes 4 parameters to define the three vertices:
//      1) G4FacetvertexType = "ABSOLUTE": in this case Pt0, vt1 and vt2 are 
//         the 3 vertices in anti-clockwise order looking from the outsider.
//      2) G4FacetvertexType = "RELATIVE": in this case the first vertex is Pt0,
//         the second vertex is Pt0+vt1 and the third vertex is Pt0+vt2, all  
//         in anti-clockwise order when looking from the outsider.
