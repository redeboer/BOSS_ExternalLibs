// Class description:
//
//   The G4TessellatedGeometryAlgorithms class is used to contain standard
//   routines to determine whether (and if so where) simple geometric shapes
//   intersect.
//   
//   The constructor doesn't need to do anything, and neither does the
//   destructor.
//   
//   IntersectLineAndTriangle2D
//     Determines whether there is an intersection between a line defined
//     by r = p + s.v and a triangle defined by verticies P0, P0+E0 and P0+E1.
//     Here:
//        p = 2D vector
//        s = scaler on [0,infinity)
//        v = 2D vector
//        P0, E0 and E1 are 2D vectors
//     Information about where the intersection occurs is returned in the
//     variable location.
//
//   IntersectLineAndLineSegment2D
//     Determines whether there is an intersection between a line defined
//     by r = P0 + s.D0 and a line-segment with endpoints P1 and P1+D1.
//     Here:
//        P0 = 2D vector
//        s  = scaler on [0,infinity)
//        D0 = 2D vector
//        P1 and D1 are 2D vectors
//     Information about where the intersection occurs is returned in the
//     variable location.
