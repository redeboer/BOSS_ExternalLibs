// Class description:
//
//   The G4QuadrangularFacet class is used for the contruction of
//   G4TessellatedSolid.
//   It is defined by four vertices, which shall be in the same plane and be
//   supplied in anti-clockwise order looking from the outsider of the solid
//   where it belongs. Its constructor
//   
//     G4QuadrangularFacet (const G4ThreeVector Pt0, const G4ThreeVector vt1,
//                          const G4ThreeVector vt2, const G4ThreeVector vt3,
//                          G4FacetVertexType);
//
//   takes 5 parameters to define the four vertices:
//     1) G4FacetvertexType = "ABSOLUTE": in this case Pt0, vt1, vt2 and vt3
//        are the four vertices required in anti-clockwise order when looking
//        from the outsider.
//     2) G4FacetvertexType = "RELATIVE": in this case the first vertex is Pt0,
//        the second vertex is Pt0+vt, the third vertex is Pt0+vt2 and 
//        the fourth vertex is Pt0+vt3, in anti-clockwise order when looking 
//        from the outsider.
